## Problem Statement : (SIH1515)

<p> In India, the rapid increase in the number of vehicles has outpaced the availability of parking space, causing widespread issues like traffic congestion, on-street parking chaos, and revenue loss for operators. To address this problem, we aim to develop a smart parking solution that utilizes sensors and software to provide real-time information on available parking spaces. By optimizing parking prices based on demand, our solution not only enhances resource utilization but also generates sustainable revenue for cities. Our goal is to empower city administrators with an efficient tool for predicting, managing, and financing parking while offering citizens a user-friendly app for convenient parking reservations and payments, ultimately reducing environmental impact and promoting mobility solutions.
